    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 17, 2026</p>
    
    <p><strong>Divise</strong> ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application.</p>
    
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not collect any personal information.</strong></p>
    <p>Divise is designed with privacy in mind. All data you enter into the app including split details, names, items, and amounts is stored locally on your device only. We do not have access to this data, and it is never transmitted to any external servers.</p>
    
    <h2>Camera and Photo Library Access</h2>
    <p>Divise requests access to your device's camera and photo library solely for the purpose of scanning receipts. Images captured or selected are processed entirely on your device using Apple's Vision framework for text recognition. These images are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Never uploaded to any server</li>
        <li>Never shared with third parties</li>
        <li>Not stored permanently by the app</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All app data is stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework. This means:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your data stays on your device</li>
        <li>We cannot access your data</li>
        <li>Deleting the app removes all associated data</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Divise does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. We do not share any information with third parties.</p>
    
    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Divise does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13. The app is a general purpose utility for splitting bills and does not target children.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.</p>
